                <p>The Zero Point Energy Field Manipulator, commonly known as the Gravity Gun, is a tractor beam-type weapon designed for handling hazardous materials, but as Alyx Vance stated, primarily used for heavy lifting. At its core is a substance that appears to be a Xen crystal. Introduced to the player by Alyx Vance shortly after arrival at Black Mesa East, the Gravity Gun soon becomes a valuable tool in Gordon Freeman's arsenal. The Gravity Gun is considered one of Freeman's trademark weapons alongside his signature weapon, the crowbar.</p>

            <section>
                <p>The Gravity Gun has two modes. The primary fire releases an energy blast that punts the targeted object with tremendous force. The gravity gun is useful for clearing out barriers and moving heavy objects. The secondary fire picks items up and holds them just ahead of the gun. These objects can then either be dropped by pressing the secondary fire button a second time or punted with the primary fire. The secondary fire can only pick up lighter objects, mainly those which Gordon himself could carry, but the prime fire is capable of punting much larger things even if the secondary fire cannot affect them. The gun cannot affect most organic material, though there are a few exceptions, such as wood.</p>

            <section>
                <p>The Gravity Gun is most effectively used as a short to mid-range weapon since the physics objects it uses for ammunition are affected by gravity. Because of this, the gravity gun is one of the most suitable weapons for Ravenholm before getting the shotgun, due to the large amounts of environmental props and the fact that ammunition is somewhat scarce there. </p>

            <h1>Supercharged</h1>
            <section>
                <p>When exposed to the Confiscation Field in the Citadel, the Gravity Gun is "supercharged" rather than being vaporized as other weapons are. It also shorts out the field in the process. Once supercharged, the Gravity Gun emits blue light rather than orange, quakes in Gordon's hands, and creates small bolts of energy across its muzzle. Its powers are vastly enhanced, enabling it to manipulate objects of far greater mass than it normally could as well as pull and repel them with greater force. Its most significant enhancement, however, is its ability to manipulate organic matter. Any Overwatch Soldier punted by it is instantly killed, and their body retains a charge that will kill others if it strikes them. If grabbed by the gun's secondary fire, they are likewise killed. It also has the side effect of vaporizing any weapons the soldiers were carrying.</p>

            <section>
                <p>The first time the Gravity Gun is supercharged is in Half-Life 2's twelfth chapter, Our Benefactors when Gordon's pod deposits him into a Confiscation Field and remains so until the end of the game. During this time, Citadel power chargers restore Gordon's health and boost energy to 200% as well. At the start of Episode One, it is no longer supercharged (yet the chargers keep the effect from the first game's citadel) but becomes charged again after Gordon and Alyx re-enter the Citadel to stabilize the core when Gordon accidentally enters another Confiscation Field. It remains supercharged until Gordon reactivates the core's containment field, at which point the Gravity Gun reverts to its normal state.</p>

            <section>
                <p>In Episode One, during the sequence where the supercharged Gravity Gun is used, enemies killed by Alyx will still lose their weapons as if hit by the Gravity Gun. This is likely intentional, as the purpose of the Gravity Gun destroying enemy weapons is to prevent the player from taking them during the sequence.</p>

            <section>
                <p>Using the developer console, the player can augment the Gravity Gun's power. </p>
                <p>The supercharged Gravity Gun can be activated in normal use by entering the command "physcannon_mega_enabled 1". If this command is enabled, any NPC's weapon will disintegrate when they die, even outside the Citadel, regardless of what weapon it is.</p>
                <p>If the player picks up a Combine APC or a Scout Car using the supercharged Gravity Gun, the game will either slow the framerate down dramatically or crash. The muscle car should not be picked up due to faults in the physics engine.</p>
                <p>When attacking any invincible NPC with the supercharged Gravity Gun the corpse spawns, but the NPC remains unaffected.</p>
